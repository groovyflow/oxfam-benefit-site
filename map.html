    <p>The benefit is at the Main Line School of Rock.  The address is 511 Old Lancaster Road, Suite 4, Berwyn, PA 19312</p>
    <p>But Google Maps will take you to the wrong Old Lancaster Avenue!  In fact, Old Lancaster Avenue seems like the only road name that
    Berwyn could come up with.</p>
    </p>You'll want to go to the Old Lancaster Avenue that's across the street from Handel's Ice Cream, and that runs behind Casey's Ale House and Mr. Bottle.
   Somehow Google Maps has named that road Lincoln Highway in the map below. The School of Rock is on the left hand side if you're driving from Handel's,
   and will be between Bikram Yoga and the Bagel Factory.
